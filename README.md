<i>For the Data Science Specialization Course</i>
Author: Silvia Behrens (University of Strathclyde)

Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")
                                                
## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script

## Review Criteria
1. The submitted [data set]https://github.com/SilviaStrathclyde/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/main/TidyData.txt) is tidy. 
2. The [Github repo](https://github.com/SilviaStrathclyde/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project) contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available [codebooks](https://github.com/SilviaStrathclyde/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/main/CodeBook.md) with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The [README](https://github.com/SilviaStrathclyde/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/main/README.md) that explains the [analysis files](https://github.com/SilviaStrathclyde/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/main/run_analysis.R) is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
